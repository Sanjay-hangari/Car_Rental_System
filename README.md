# Car_Rental_System

A car rental is a vehicle that can be used temporarily for a period of time with a fee.
Renting a car assists people to get around even when they do not have access to their own
personal vehicle or donâ€™t own a vehicle at all. The individual who want to rent a car must first
contact the car rental company for the desired vehicle. This can be done online. At this point,
this person has to supply some information such as: dates of rental, and type of car. After these
details are worked out, the individual renting the car must present a valid Identification card.
